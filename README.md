`AlpNat` is a collection of code which I've done during the work of on one of my Master Thesis. The package was created to provide the code for future research related on this topic



## Installation

`AlpNat` is currently only available through GitHub and can be downloaded easily using devtools:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pi-ledge/AlpNat")
```


To avoid some errors installing devtools on Ubuntu, you may need to install some packages on the host prior to the installation:

```
sudo apt install libgdal-dev r-base-dev libudunits2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libzmq3-dev libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev libtiff5-dev libjpeg-dev build-essential libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev libfontconfig1-dev -y
```
